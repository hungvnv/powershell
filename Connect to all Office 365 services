Before you begin
Before you can manage all of Office 365 from a single instance of Windows PowerShell, consider the following prerequisites:

The Office 365 work or school account that you use for these procedures needs to be a member of an Office 365 admin role. For more information, see About Office 365 admin roles. This a requirement for Office 365 PowerShell, not necessarily for all other Office 365 services.

You can use the following 64-bit versions of Windows:

Windows 10

Windows 8.1 or Windows 8

Windows Server 2019

Windows Server 2016

Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012

Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1)*

Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1*

* You need to install the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.x and then either the Windows Management Framework 3.0 or the Windows Management Framework 4.0. For more information, see Installing the .NET Framework and Windows Management Framework 3.0 or Windows Management Framework 4.0.

You need to use a 64-bit version of Windows because of the requirements for the Skype for Business Online module and one of the Office 365 modules.

You need to install the modules that are required for Azure AD, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business Online:

Azure Active Directory V2
SharePoint Online Management Shell
Skype for Business Online, Windows PowerShell Module
Windows PowerShell needs to be configured to run signed scripts for Skype for Business Online, Exchange Online, and the Security & Compliance Center. To do this, run the following command in an elevated Windows PowerShell session (a Windows PowerShell window you open by selecting Run as administrator).


Copy
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Connection steps when using a password
Here are the steps to connect to all the services in a single PowerShell window.

Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator (use Run as administrator).

Run this command, and enter your Office 365 work or school account credentials.


Copy
$credential = Get-Credential
Run this command to connect to Azure Active Directory (AD) using the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module.

Copy
 Connect-AzureAD -Credential $credential
Alternately, if you are using the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module, run this command.


Copy
 Connect-MsolService -Credential $credential
Run these commands to connect to SharePoint Online. Replace <domainhost> with the actual value for your domain. For example, for "litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com", the <domainhost> value is "litwareinc".

Copy
Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking
Connect-SPOService -Url https://<domainhost>-admin.sharepoint.com -credential $credential
Run these commands to connect to Skype for Business Online. A warning about increasing the WSMan NetworkDelayms value is expected the first time you connect and should be ignored.

Copy
Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
Import-PSSession $sfboSession
Run these commands to connect to Exchange Online.

Copy
$exchangeSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri "https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/" -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
Import-PSSession $exchangeSession
Run these commands to connect to the Security & Compliance Center.

Copy
$SccSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
Import-PSSession $SccSession -Prefix cc
Here are all the commands in a single block when using the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph module. Specify the name of your domain host, and then run them all at one time.


Copy
$domainHost="<domain host name, such as litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
$credential = Get-Credential
Connect-AzureAD -Credential $credential
Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking
Connect-SPOService -Url https://$domainHost-admin.sharepoint.com -credential $credential
Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
Import-PSSession $sfboSession
$exchangeSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri "https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/" -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
Import-PSSession $exchangeSession
$SccSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
Import-PSSession $SccSession -Prefix cc
Alternately, here are all the commands in a single block when using the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module. Specify the name of your domain host, and then run them all at one time.


Copy
$domainHost="<domain host name, such as litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
$credential = Get-Credential
Connect-MsolService -Credential $credential
Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking
Connect-SPOService -Url https://$domainHost-admin.sharepoint.com -credential $credential
Import-Module SkypeOnlineConnector
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -Credential $credential
Import-PSSession $sfboSession
$exchangeSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri "https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/" -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
Import-PSSession $exchangeSession
$SccSession = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $credential -Authentication "Basic" -AllowRedirection
Import-PSSession $SccSession -Prefix cc
When you are ready to close down the Windows PowerShell window, run this command to remove the active sessions to Skype for Business Online, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and the Security & Compliance Center:


Copy
Remove-PSSession $sfboSession ; Remove-PSSession $exchangeSession ; Remove-PSSession $SccSession ; Disconnect-SPOService
Connection steps when using multi-factor authentication
Here are all the commands in a single block to connect to Azure AD, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Buiness using multi-factor authentication in a single window. Specify the user principal name (UPN) name of a global administrator account and your domain host name, and then run them all at one time.


Copy
$acctName="<UPN of a global administrator account>"
$domainHost="<domain host name, such as litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
#Azure Active Directory
Connect-AzureAD
#SharePoint Online
Connect-SPOService -Url https://$domainHost-admin.sharepoint.com
#Skype for Business Online
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -UserName $acctName
Import-PSSession $sfboSession
Alternately, here are all the commands when using the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell module.


Copy
$acctName="<UPN of a global administrator account>"
$domainHost="<domain host name, such as litwareinc for litwareinc.onmicrosoft.com>"
#Azure Active Directory
Connect-MsolService
#SharePoint Online
Connect-SPOService -Url https://$domainHost-admin.sharepoint.com
#Skype for Business Online
$sfboSession = New-CsOnlineSession -UserName $acctName
Import-PSSession $sfboSession
For Exchange Online and the Security & Compliance Center, see the following topics to connect using multi-factor authentication:

Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell using multi-factor authentication
Connect to Office 365 Security & Compliance Center PowerShell using multi-factor authentication
Note that in both cases, you must connect using separate sessions of the Exchange Online Remote PowerShell Module.
